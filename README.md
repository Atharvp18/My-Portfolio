# Atharv's Portfolio Repository

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website! This repository contains the code, assets, and resources used to build and deploy my personal portfolio website.

## About the Portfolio

My portfolio showcases my education, projects, certificates and some of my paintings as a <Btech /> student in Computer Science at NIT, Surat. Through this website, I aim to demonstrate my passion for technology, development, and problem-solving. For having a look at my portfolio [click here](https://atharvp18.github.io/Portfolio/).
